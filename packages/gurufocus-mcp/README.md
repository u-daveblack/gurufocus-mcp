# Unofficial GuruFocus MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes GuruFocus financial data to AI assistants like Claude. Built with FastMCP for seamless integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients.

## Features

- **15 Analysis Tools**: Stock summaries, valuations, financials, and more
- **13 Data Resources**: Direct access to formatted financial data via URI templates
- **5 Analysis Prompts**: Structured frameworks for investment analysis
- **Multiple Transports**: stdio (Claude Desktop), HTTP/SSE, WebSocket
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid symbols, rate limits, and API errors

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- GuruFocus API token ([Get one here](https://www.gurufocus.com/api.php))

## Installation

```bash
pip install gurufocus-mcp
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv add gurufocus-mcp
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Set your API token

```bash
export GURUFOCUS_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

### 2. Run the server

```bash
# Default stdio transport (for Claude Desktop)
gurufocus-mcp

# HTTP transport for web clients
gurufocus-mcp --transport http --port 8000
```

## Claude Desktop Integration

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gurufocus": {
      "command": "gurufocus-mcp",
      "env": {
        "GURUFOCUS_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If using uv or a virtual environment:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gurufocus": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "gurufocus-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GURUFOCUS_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After adding the configuration, restart Claude Desktop. You should see the GuruFocus tools available in Claude's interface.
